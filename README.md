# üöß Experimental: Travel/Hexcrawl + Framework V2 (NocTempre fork)

**Status:** Alpha. Breaking changes likely. Test in a fresh world and keep backups. Do **not** open issues upstream for these experiments. This fork tracks Autarch‚Äôs core and layers prototypes on top.

## What‚Äôs being prototyped

* **Framework V2 (system architecture roadmap).** Internal refactor notes for a slimmer ‚Äúengine core‚Äù and clearer extension points. See `FRAMEWORK_V2_Roadmap.md`.
* **Hexcrawl integration with Hexplorer.**

  * **Bridge:** syncing ACKS travel/time with Hexplorer hex state and tools (`HEXPLORER_BRIDGE.md`).
  * **Brush:** GM utilities for painting/maintaining exploration data on hex maps (`HEXPLORER_BRUSH.md`). 
  * **Integration notes & limits:** see `HEXPLORER_INTEGRATION.md` and `INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md`.
  * Hexplorer module info: Foundry package + wiki.
* **Travel/Logistics ‚ÄúParty‚Äù tooling.**
  Design for a party-level travel actor (speed, watches, supplies, encumbrance roll-ups, time advancement): `TRAVEL_PARTY_DESIGN.md` and `TRAVEL_PARTY_UPGRADE.md`. Optional interaction with party/overview modules is being evaluated, not required.
* **Road Network model.**
  Draft mechanics for roads/trails and their effect on movement and hazard frequency: `ROAD_SYSTEM.md`.
* **Test harness.**
  WIP unit/fixture scaffolding for travel math and data integrity in `acks-tests/`.

## Try it (safe defaults)

1. **Clone this fork** and install as a local system (keep your main ACKS II system installed separately).
2. **New empty world.** Import nothing critical until you‚Äôre happy.
3. **Install Hexplorer** (premium) if you want hex features; otherwise the core still runs.
4. **Read the per-feature docs** linked above; enable only what you need.

## Known risks & caveats

* **Data format may change.** `old_packs/` and `srcdata/` may be reshaped; migrations are not guaranteed yet. Back up often.
* **Integration modules are optional.** Hexplorer adds hex tools; party helper modules are convenience only. If something conflicts, disable the add-on first.
* **Upstream parity.** This fork rebases periodically on Autarch‚Äôs system; experimental files are clearly separated and may not ever be merged upstream.

## Contributing/feedback

Open issues **here** (this fork) with reproducible steps and the feature tag (e.g., `hexplorer-bridge`, `party-travel`, `roads`). Please don‚Äôt file experimental bugs on Autarch‚Äôs repo.
