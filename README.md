# ACKS II Core System for FoundryVTT (NocTempre Fork)

**Status:** Alpha - Experimental Features. Test in a fresh world and keep backups.

This is an experimental fork of the official ACKS II system, adding hexcrawl/travel management features while tracking upstream development. **Do not** open issues for experimental features on Autarch's official repository.

---

## What's New in This Fork

This fork extends the official ACKS II system with comprehensive travel and hexploration features:

### üó∫Ô∏è Hexplorer Integration
Complete terrain-based movement system with optional Hexplorer module support:
- **17 terrain types** with accurate ACKS II movement multipliers, navigation throws, and encounter distances
- **Multi-layer support**: Ground, water, and air travel with appropriate vessels/mounts
- **Weather system**: 6 weather conditions affecting movement and navigation
- **Road types**: Earth, gravel, and paved roads with speed bonuses and driving proficiency support
- **Standalone or integrated**: Works without Hexplorer, but integrates seamlessly when installed

**Documentation**: See [Changelog.md](Changelog.md) for upstream ACKS II updates

### üõ§Ô∏è Edge-Based Road System
Roads are painted on hex edges (connections between hexes) rather than in hexes:
- **Directional roads**: Connect specific hex pairs, not entire hexes
- **Speed bonuses**: 1.5x base speed (2x with Driving proficiency)
- **Weather effects**: Rain makes earth roads ineffective, snow affects all roads
- **Visual representation**: Colored lines on hex edges (brown/gray/dark gray)

### üéí Travel Party System
New "Travel Party" actor type for managing overland expeditions:
- **Party composition**: Add characters, henchmen, and pack animals to travel groups
- **Vehicle/mount management**: Assign drivers, passengers, and cargo
- **Automatic calculations**: Speed based on slowest member, terrain, roads, and weather
- **Encumbrance tracking**: Real-time weight distribution across party members and animals
- **Item transfer system**: Lend gear to pack animals and retrieve it later
- **Container support**: Bags, chests, and magical containers (bag of holding with weight reduction)
- **Split groups**: Manage multiple sub-parties with separate tracking

### üì¶ Advanced Encumbrance System
Sophisticated item ownership and transfer mechanics:
- **Item lending**: Transfer items between party members with retrieval restrictions
- **Delegated items**: Track who has your gear and retrieve it when needed
- **Container system**: Nested items with capacity and weight reduction
- **Vehicle cargo**: Automatic calculation of passenger weight + crew + items
- **Overload warnings**: Visual indicators for overencumbered members and vehicles
- **Mount equipment**: Data structures ready for saddles, harnesses, and barding (future)

### üîÆ Framework V2 Architecture
Long-term architectural improvements for maintainability:
- Migration to Foundry v12+ DataModel
- Modular system design with clear extension points
- App v2 interface migration (ongoing)
- Separation of core mechanics from content

## Installation

### Method 1: As Additional System (Recommended for Testing)
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Place in `Data/systems/acks-fork` (or similar name)
3. Create a new world using this system
4. Your official ACKS II system remains unchanged

### Method 2: Replace Official System (Not Recommended)
Only if you want to use experimental features in existing worlds:
1. **Backup your world first!**
2. Replace the official ACKS system files
3. Data migrations are not guaranteed

### Optional Module Integrations
Install these modules for enhanced functionality:
- **Hexplorer** - Hex-based map painting and exploration tools
- **Simple Calendar** / **Small Time** - Weather and time tracking
- **Weather Control** - Weather effects integration

Enable integrations in: **Game Settings** ‚Üí **System Settings** ‚Üí **ACKS Settings**

## Quick Start Guide

### Using Terrain Movement Calculations
Works even without Hexplorer installed:

1. Open a character sheet
2. Access movement calculator via console or macro:
```javascript
const actor = game.actors.getName("Character Name");
const result = game.acks.hexplorer.calculateHexMovement(
  actor,
  "forest-deciduous",
  {
    roadType: "earth",
    weather: "clear",
    partySize: 6,
    hasDriving: false
  }
);
```

### Creating a Travel Party
1. Create a new "Travel Party" actor
2. Drag characters and pack animals onto the party sheet
3. Assign animals as draft animals (set `draftAnimal.enabled` and `normalLoad`)
4. Transfer gear from characters to pack animals (right-click items)
5. Monitor encumbrance and speed on the party sheet

### Transferring Items to Pack Animals
1. Right-click any weapon, armor, or equipment item on a character sheet
2. Select **"Transfer to Party Member"**
3. Choose the recipient (mule, wagon, etc.)
4. Set retrieval restriction (default: same-party)
5. Item is removed from character and added to animal
6. Encumbrance updates automatically

### Retrieving Delegated Items
1. Open the character sheet
2. Click **"Retrieve Delegated Items"** button
3. Select items to retrieve (grayed if outside retrieval range)
4. Items return to your character

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Experimental Features
- **Breaking changes likely**: Data structures may change between versions
- **No migration guarantees**: Backup before updating
- **Limited testing**: Use in test worlds first
- **Module conflicts possible**: Disable integrations if issues occur

### Specific Limitations
- **Road painting UI**: Manual API calls required (UI tool planned)
- **Mount equipment**: Data structures ready but not implemented
- **Encounter automation**: Time-based rolls not yet automated
- **Pathfinding**: No automatic route calculation yet
- **Lair placement**: Manual only

### Compatibility
- **Foundry VTT**: v12+ (v13 compatible)
- **ACKS II System**: Tracks official upstream releases
- **Hexplorer**: Optional, any version (hooks may need adjustment)
- **Conflicts**: None known, but integrations are optional

---

## Troubleshooting

### Integration Not Working
1. Check module is installed and active
2. Enable integration in **Game Settings** ‚Üí **System Settings** ‚Üí **ACKS Settings**
3. Reload Foundry
4. Check browser console for errors

### Items Won't Transfer
1. Verify both actors are in a Travel Party
2. Check item type (spells, abilities, languages, money cannot transfer)
3. Look for console errors

### Can't Retrieve Items
1. Check retrieval restriction setting
2. Verify actors meet restriction criteria (same party/hex/scene)
3. Ensure item still exists on carrier

### Encumbrance Not Updating
1. Force recalculation: `actor.computeEncumbrance()`
2. Check item `weight6` property is set
3. Verify character vs monster encumbrance type

### Roads Not Applying
1. Check road exists between hexes: `RoadPainter.getRoadBetween(cell1, cell2)`
2. Verify road type in scene flags
3. Check weather hasn't made road ineffective
